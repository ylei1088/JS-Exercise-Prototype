  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.
*/

// EXAMPLE SOLUTION CODE:
function Airplane(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isFlying = false;
}
Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
  this.isFlying = true;
};
Airplane.prototype.land = function () {
  this.isFlying = false;

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/*
    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
      - All instances built with Car:
          + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
          + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
      - Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank`.
      - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)`. The distance driven:
          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
          + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.
  */

function Car() {}

/*
    TASK 3
      - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
      - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
      - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`:
          + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.
  */
function Baby() {}

/* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. in window object binding, the value of 'this' will be the window/console Object

    2. implicit binding is whenever preceding dot calla a function, the object before the dot is this.

    3. new bingding use a constructor function, 'this' refer to specific instance of the object is created and returned by the constructor function.

    4. explicit binding is explicitly defined.
